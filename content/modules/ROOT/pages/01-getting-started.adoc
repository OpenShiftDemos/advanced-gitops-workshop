[#cluster-login]
== OpenShift Cluster Login

The first thing to do is log in to your OpenShift cluster with the following
information:

*OpenShift Console*
link:{console_url}[{console_url},window='_blank']

*Username*

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{user}
----

*Password*

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{password}
----

Clicking the link above for the OpenShift Console will take you to the OpenShift
login screen where you can login using the provided username and password.

Once logged in, make sure that you choose the _Developer_ perspective using the
switcher in the upper-left:

[#open-web-terminal]
== Workshop Web Terminal

On the right side of your screen is a web terminal which includes many of the
necessary command-line tools you need to interact with. By default the terminal
is logged in with a service account with limited permissions, execute the following
command to login as {user}.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
{login_command}
----

When you login, you will see a prompt about using an insecure connection as the Kubernetes API
in this workshop is using a default certificate. Type `y` to accept and the login will continue.

*Once completed you should see the following in the terminal:*

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
[lab-user: ~]$ {login_command}
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n): y

WARNING: Using insecure TLS client config. Setting this option is not supported!

Login successful.

You have access to the following projects and can switch between them with 'oc project <project-name>':

  * {user}-argocd
    {user}-dev
    {user}-prod
    {user}-stage
Using project "{user}-argocd".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----

[TIP]
====
In order to copy and paste content into the terminal, you can use
the secondary (typically right click) menus to do so. You can also
use the keyboard to paste content with the shortcut &lt;ctrl&gt;&lt;shift&gt;&lt;v&gt;.

[#argocd-login]
== Argo CD Login

While Argo CD generates a default `admin` user and a random password when first
deployed you can also configure Argo CD to use the OpenShift authentication.
You can connect to Argo CD using this user account via the CLI or web
console.  In this workshop, we will only use the Argo CD web console.

Click on the following link to access the Argo CD user interface:

link:https://argocd-server-{user}-argocd.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[https://argocd-server-{user}-argocd.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain},window='_blank']

Click on the `Log In Via OpenShift` button and use the same username
and password that you used to login in with OpenShift.

After you enter your credentials you will see the following prompting you to authorize access,
click the "Allow selected permissions" button.

image::argo-cd-allow-access.png[ArgoCDAuthorize, 600]

Once you've logged in, you should see the following page. This is the Argo CD
Web UI.

[#argocd-cli]
== Argo CD CLI

The Argo CD CLI enables users to interact with Argo CD via a command line. It is useful as a way to integrate Argo CD into scripts as well as for general usage. There are two ways to login into the CLI. The preferred way is to login using your Argo CD
account so that Argo CD RBAC is applied.

The second way is to use the `--core` switch which logs in using the Kubernetes context. This can be useful as
a fallback if for some reason the Argo CD CLI is not working as expected. Also link:https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/core[Argo CD Core, window="_blank"] is
a lightweight version of Argo CD that does not include the Server component and thus no UI or API is
available. In this case logging in with core mode is the only option.

[NOTE]
Normally when using Argo CD with OIDC, the login would be accomplished using the `--sso` switch
which starts up a local web server to handle the OIDC callback on localhost. However, since
our terminal is running in a pod in OpenShift, this is not possible. Therefore here we will
use the `--core` switch since you own the Argo CD instance and thus RBAC is not an issue.

To login into Argo CD, execute the following:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd login --core
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
Context 'kubernetes' updated
----

[NOTE]
If you get an error about requiring `0400` or `0600` permissions, you can
correct it by executing `chmod 0600 .config/argocd/config`.

Test your login with the following command to list projects:

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd proj list
----

You should see that a single Project, `default` is available:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
NAME      DESCRIPTION       DESTINATIONS    SOURCES  CLUSTER-RESOURCE-WHITELIST  NAMESPACE-RESOURCE-BLACKLIST  SIGNATURE-KEYS  ORPHANED-RESOURCES  DESTINATION-SERVICE-ACCOUNTS
default                     *,*             *        */*                         <none>                        <none>          disabled            <none>
----

The Argo CD CLI supports a variety of commands, these can be viewed with the `--help` command.

[.console-input]
[source,sh,subs="attributes",role=execute]
----
argocd --help

[#gitops-architecture]
== OpenShift GitOps Architecture

In this section, we will perform a brief overview of the OpenShift GitOps architecture which is depicted in the diagram below.

image::argocd-architecture.png[]

[NOTE]
In the diagram above, everything contained within the dotted line is running in OpenShift, whereas outside the line are external
dependencies or interactions.

The OpenShift GitOps operator is used to deploy, manage and upgrade an installation of Argo CD which runs in a
specified namespace. The Argo CD installation contains several components, running as individual deployments,
which are as follows:

1. *Application Controller*. This component is responsible for deploying Kubernetes resources and watching the resources for changes. 
To do so, it interacts with the Kubernetes API.
2. *Repo Server*. This component manages access to the manifests via a git or helm repository. It is responsible for
fetching the manifests (i.e. yaml files). These manifests can be built from raw yaml, helm or kustomize. Additional tools can be used via a plugin architecture. For improved performance, it caches these manifests
in the redis component.
3. *Server*. This provides the user interface as well as a REST API.
4. *Dex (optional)*. Provides authentication via OpenShift OAuth2, in this workshop it is not used as we
are authenticating directly against Keycloak.
5. *ApplicationSet Controller (Not shown)*. This component is responsible for managing ApplicationSets which
are used to generate Applications using generators. These generators can create Applications based on Pull Requests,
directories in git, clusters, etc.

Check that these have been deployed successfully in your Argo CD namespace:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="attributes+,+macros"]
----
oc get all -n {user}-argocd
----

The output should be similar to below:
